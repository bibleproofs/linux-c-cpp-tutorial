- - - listing 01a
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  cout << "DOXA TO THEO+++";
  cout << endl;
  cout << "Glory Forever!";
  cout << endl;
  return 0;
}

note the #include <iostream> is how we make use of the input output library
iostream is the name of the c++ library for input and output
we need the iostream library to use the cout function
the cout function is used to print (output) 
cout stands for 'console out'
in c, the standard function we use is printf() 
printf uses a different and more complex syntax
printf is part of the "stdio.h" standard c library file

- - - listing 01b - - - 
this is the smallest program in c / c++

int main() {
  return 0;
}

- - - 

it will work the same even if change it to the following

- - - listing 01c - - -
main() {
}

- - -
note: most compilers will give you warning about the ommitted portion(s)
but the program will still compile 
- - -
every c and c++ program should contain a function called main
most programs will consist of many functions
functions are one of the building blocks of programming

funtion_name() {
  // function body goes here 
}

functions return a value unless they are specified as a void function
void function_name() {
}

// two forward slashes denote a single line comment
comments are for human consumption and are ignored by the compiler

make a directory on your Desktop folder called cpp-tutorial
create a file called doxa.cpp by using the touch command
touch doxa.cpp
if you do an ls you should now see the doxa.cpp file
you can edit a text file using the nano text editor
nano <name of file>
in this case we want to do 
nano doxa.cpp
type in listing1a source code
save the file with a control-x and answer y to the prompt to save
now compile the file as follows from the terminal
gcc -o doxa doxa.cpp -lstdc++
gcc -o <name of executable> <name of source file> -lstdc++
the -o specifies the output file name

this will create an executable (same as binary) file called doxa
you can execute (run) doxa by typing :
./doxa 
remember . specifices the current directory
./doxa specifies the doxa executable file is in the current directory

write and compile listing 01b. the source code should be called nothing.cpp
and the executable should be called nothing

write and comple listing 01c. the source code should be called nothing2.cpp
and the executable should be called nothing2
