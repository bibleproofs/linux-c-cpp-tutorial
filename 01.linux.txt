01. linux tutorial (basics)
introduction to the linux terminal, navigating directories, making and deleting folders

open the linux terminal (the terminal is known as the shell)
in windows the shell is usually called the "command prompt"
but in linux we refer to this as the terminal 

you can exit the terminal by typing the command 
exit 
try this command to exit the terminal 

by default the linux terminal opens to your home directory

/home/your_profile_name

a directory (linux) is the same as a folder 

the / is known as the root directory 
each folder is seperated by a / (forward slash) 
in windows folders are seperated by a \ (back slash) instead

on a linux system, your desktop is :
/home/your_profile_name/Desktop

linux directory paths are case sensitive 

at any point you can find your current directry with the command
  pwd
pwd is short for print working directory 

you can see the contents of the current directory by typing
  ls 
ls is short for list, as in list the contents of the current directory 

type the pwd command to see the current directory you are in
type the ls command to see the contents of your current directory
the output is color coded to seperate folders and various types of files
note the color used on your system for folders 

you can change directory by the cd command followed by the path of the directory you 
want to navigate to

 cd <followed by the directory path>
cd is short for change directory 

a directory path can be relative or absolute
/home/profile_name/Downloads would be an example of an absolute (or full) path

if you are already in /home/profile_name you can change to your Desktop folder
by typing
cd Desktop
this would be an example of a relative path

the command cd by itself will take you to your home directory
cd .. 
the two dots means the parent directory 
if you are in /home/profile_name/Desktop and you type in cd ..
it should take you to /home/profile_name
if you again type cd ..
it should take you to /home
if you again type cd ..
it should take you to /
.. means the parent directory
. means the current directory 

cd .. goes one folder up
cd ../.. goes two folders up
cd ../../.. goes three folders up etc

now change to your home directory
type pwd to make sure you are in the home directory
it should output /home/your_profile_name

you can make a directory by the following command
mkdir <folder_name>

make a folder called test
change into this folder 
type pwd to make sure you are in the test folder you just made
it should output /home/your_profile_name/test

navigate to your Desktop directory
make a directory on your Desktop called test2
do an ls to make sure the directory is showing
also you can check your Desktop to confirm the directory 'test2' is showing

you can remove a directory using the rm (remove) command as follows
rm -r test2
be careful when you use rm and other deletion commands
because the deletion cannot be undone

make a list of all the commands covered here
type a command name followed by --help to see the help file for the command
for example
pwd --help
